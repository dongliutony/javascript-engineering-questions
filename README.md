  <h1>JavaScript Engineering Questions</h1>

---

<span>From basic to advanced: test how well you know JavaScript, refresh your knowledge a bit, give you some idea of handling engineering tricks, or prepare for your coding interview! I update this repo regularly with new questions. I added the answers in the **collapsed sections** below the questions, simply click on them to expand it. It's just for fun, good luck! :heart:</span>
